### What I learned

I reviewed the use of the h3 tag and was able to recap what it was for
At the same time I was able to repair and see how well I was doing with my css styles

```html
<h3>A tag that caught my attention for its use</h3>
```
```css
.content{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
    width: 280px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    margin: 100px auto;
    padding: 12px;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus more on acquiring more knowledge and improving my mobile designs as well as responsive
